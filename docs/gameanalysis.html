           Tikvah, who lives with her goats and chickens in a remote homestead. It's a quiet and lonely existence where you point and click to pet goats, milk goats, fetch water from a well to water a plant, collect eggs from the hen house, pray, make cheese, doodle on the ground with a stick or simply do nothing at all. 
           You'll soon find that Tikvah's tasks bring her joy, though; she whistles with charm as she slowly milks her goats.
           There is no clock in the game; as the days march on, you learn to tell the time by the changing colours of the minimalist landscape. The only human interaction in Where The Goats Are comes in the form of a trader who passes through, bringing letters from relatives. He trades hay and goats in exchange for cheese, 
           but never stays for long. There is no instruction so the player needs to "learn as you go". One important thing in this game is anything that you can interact with, it highlights.

            Most of the objects are things that Tikvah use to get her chores done or make goat cheese, which is her major duty that contributes to this game.
            For example, chores such as milking, collecting egges from chicken, watering her plant is her duty for each day. Out of Tikvah herself and other people who sends her letters,
            there is one more person that I consider their roll in this game is important alsol. As walks around her farm, there are few of her footsteps of where she stepped on.  
        </p>

        <p class="GAtextborder">
            As she's the only person that player can see when they first start the game, it's very confusing to figure out what you have to do. Therefore, I assume this game definetly requires some curiosity and advanturous personality from the player.
            After clicking Tikvah, you can read the very first letter. In this game, letter is almost the only way to understand the content, style of this game. Recieving different
            letters from Tikvah's friends and family as it goes, player will start to understand what is actually happening in this game. Also why she's left alone with her goats!

            In the Kumu Analysis, it introduce you to all of the characters, objects, animals and also what kind of chores that Tikvah does through out this game within fun connections. 
            Creating connection with tag such as "Letter", "Trade", "Chores" and "Animal" allows you to easily understand which charcter has sent letter to Tikvah, what does Tikvah trade, what is her daily chores, and also the connection between Tikvah and her lovely animals.
