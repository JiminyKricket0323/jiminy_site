           Tikvah, who lives with her goats and chickens in a remote homestead. It's a quiet and lonely existence where you point and click to pet goats, milk goats, fetch water from a well to water a plant, collect eggs from the hen house, pray, make cheese, doodle on the ground with a stick or simply do nothing at all. 
           You'll soon find that Tikvah's tasks bring her joy, though; she whistles with charm as she slowly milks her goats.
           There is no clock in the game; as the days march on, you learn to tell the time by the changing colours of the minimalist landscape. The only human interaction in Where The Goats Are comes in the form of a trader who passes through, bringing letters from relatives. He trades hay and goats in exchange for cheese, 
           but never stays for long. There is no instruction so the player needs to "learn as you go". One important thing in this game is anything that you can interact with, it highlights.

            Most of the objects are things that Tikvah use to get her chores done or make goat cheese, which is her major duty that contributes to this game.
            For example, chores such as milking, collecting egges from chicken, watering her plant is her duty for each day. Out of Tikvah herself and other people who sends her letters,
            there is one more person that I consider their roll in this game is important alsol. As walks around her farm, there are few of her footsteps of where she stepped on.

            As she's the only person that player can see when they first start the game, it's very confusing to figure out what you have to do. Therefore, I assume this game definetly requires some curiosity and advanturous personality from the player.
            After clicking Tikvah, you can read the very first letter. In this game, letter is almost the only way to understand the content, style of this game. Recieving different
            letters from Tikvah's friends and family as it goes, player will start to understand what is actually happening in this game. Also why she's left alone with her goats!

            In the Kumu Analysis, it introduce you to all of the characters, objects, animals and also what kind of chores that Tikvah does through out this game within fun connections. 
            Creating connection with tag such as "Letter", "Trade", "Chores" and "Animal" allows you to easily understand which charcter has sent letter to Tikvah, what does Tikvah trade, what is her daily chores, and also the connection between Tikvah and her lovely animals.

            This is the how she makes her homemade goat cheese from the scratch. First she milk the goat when they're "NOT HUNGRY". When you click on goat, you have two choices of whether you want to give them loving pet or milk them.
            After collecting some goat milk, she pours all the fresh goat milk into the big pot and starts boiling them by clicking the boil button from the pot. After few minutes, goat cheese is done and ready to trade with the mail man.

            When the mail man who is comes in the form of a trader who passes through, bringing letters from relatives. He trades hay and goats in exchange for cheese, but never stays for long.
            By clicking him, there's 2 options which is trading hay or goat with Tikvah's goat cheese. Personally, I've never traded for a new goat, but when you trade hay from him, it falls from the sky and land on where hay always was.

            All the letters that Tikvah has received from her relatives interestingly till towards complaining about their new life in the city but at the same time, it's better than living on the farm. As Talm says, she has never seen a factory before but at the same time, she gives the feeling of she's still accepting it as it's part of the new city life. 
            Also how Rorik mentioned in his poem that he wrote when he was drunk that he was one grass and now he's the sea means that he's happy that he came out to a bigger world that allows him to widen his eyes. But at the same time, he's also feeling the coldness of the people in the city that they've often felt the fear of something that is coming. 
            It is hard to define the purpose or goal of this game when there's no specific direction, instruction or narration. 
            However, to share my opinion, I believe this gave was letting people sink in there though to individually analyse the game. From this game, I've noticed from the letters that people in the city don't enjoy living there but still tell Tikvah needs to come to the city and widen her perspective instead of living on a farm only with her goats. 
            But I still seek through the city people are tired from the city life they've always envied for.

            Towards ending, Tikvah could not collect eggs, no milk from the goats and no water from the well. When couple of crows came over one night, the next day her farm was surrounded by group of crows. 
            As the game is giving out the hint that it's ending, Tikvah's footsteps got even slower, goats didn't eat the hay, chicken didn't come out, and the plant died too. First I was very
            confused that it's not letter Tikvah to do her daily duty so I wasn't quite sure what I need to do at that time. As I realised that the goats were dead, there was the button on them to bury. 
            This whole game all started with warmth of country side but ended up very emotional, lonly and cold. From my understanding, no matter of how hard she lived with her goats, eventually she had to face her dearest goats' death like
            she also can not avoid death too. The fact that few facters that everything started to dies wasn't directly related to Tikvah shows no matter where we live, we get to do our best in our lives and still
