          This N&#8211;gram shows that there was 222 frequency of the repeating word of &#8243;president&#8243; out of the total set of news articles&#46; the Average frequency of the word &#8243;president&#8243;

           This N&#8211;GRAM shows that there was a frequency of 96 of the word &#8243;president&#8243; was mentioned the entire 96 times from 44 text files&#46; Furthermore&#44; I wanted to know the average frequency of the word &#8243;president&#8243; in my collected files of 44 &#060;96&#8725;44=2&#46;18&#062; 
           which means each file might have mentioned &#8243;president&#8243; twice at least&#46;

           Moving on to Voyant&#44; I created two corpuses each from 154 files of a total set of news articles and  with my file of collections of news articles of US presidential election years&#46; The results were actually very interesting&#46; Of course&#44; the keyword map drew my attention to all of the keywords that came out as they&#8242;re are pretty similar to each other&#46;

        <p>
            Looking at this&#44; I see some vocabulary also related to politics such as&#8243;president&#8243;&#44;&#8243;national&#8243;&#44; republican&#8243;&#44; &#8243;senator&#8243;&#44; &#8243;delegates&#8243;&#44; &#8243;convention&#8243; and more! But the difference is when 44 files keyword maps are mostly showing the keywords that are related to politics but keyword maps from the 154 files are showing some words related to specific countries such as &#8243;germany&#8243;&#44; &#8243;german&#8243;&#44; &#8243;British&#8243; and &#8243;american&#8243;&#46; It&#8242;s more international&#8211;wise than the result from file collections of only news articles from the US presidential election years&#46;
