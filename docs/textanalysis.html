                This text analysis project is to seek any connections from collected news text files to presidential election years using the text analysis program AntConc and Voyant. 
                The news text files were from the COHA-historic-to-press folder that was provided by the Digit 100 Professor and then I collected only news text files from 1900 to 1950. To begin with the total set of all the files from 1900 to 1950, 
                I chose my keyword as "President" to see how many files were related to the presidential election. After that, I've focused on looking for the word "President" out of all the news files from the presidential election years 
                to compare with the other search to see if there are stronger connections. 
            </h3>
            <p class="TAP">
                There were 154 news text files (1900-1950) collected from the COHA folder, but I created another folder only with files that were from the presidential years every four years. It turned out to have a total of 44 files from categories of 13 different years.

            This table shows the number of files that were collected from the COHA folder. There were different numbers of files in each presidential election year from 1900 to 1950, some years have only one text file in certain years, but there were seven files in 1920.

        <p class="TAP">
           This NGram shows that 96 frequencies of the word "President" was mentioned throughout the 44 collected presidential years news files. Furthermore, I wanted to compare the average of both frequencies by dividing number of the files from the frequency. 
       </p>
        
        <p class="TAP">
            - Total set of news text files from 1900-1950= 222/154= 1.44 (rounded up to 2 d.p)
        </p>
        
        <p class="TAP">
            - Collected presidential years news files from 1900-1950= 96/44 = 2.18 (rounded up to 2d.p)
        </p>
           
        <p class="TAP">
            From the calculations above, in a total set of news text files from 1900-to 1950 the word "president" might've been mentioned at least once in each file. Also, in collected presidential years news files from 1900-to 1950, the word "president" might've been mentioned at least twice in each file. From this interpretation, I believe there is a stronger connection between the word "president" from the collected news file than the total set of news files.

           Moving on to Voyant, I created two separate corpuses each from the total set of the news text files from 1900-1950 and also the collected presidential election years news files from 1900-1950.

            From the keyword map of the total set, there are many words related to vocabulary, such as "government", "committee", "president", "national", "senator" and more. There are also a few words related to certain countries like "germany", "german", "american" and "british". But I'm not quite sure where the words like "New", "York" and "mr" are coming from. 
        </p>
        <p class="TAP">
            From the keyword map of the collected presidential election years news files, there are also a lot of politic related vocabulary such as "Senator", "republican", "national", "delegate", "president" and more. Same in here as well, I'm uncertain about the words "new", "mr" and "york"
        </p>
        <p class="TAP">
            Comparing both of keywords map, similarity was that they both showed similar words that were politic-related. Also the few words that I wasn't sure about also clash for both maps. However the difference is that the total set has a number of words that are related to certain countries, but in the collected file, it was easier to see more intense politic-related words. 
        </p>
        <p class="TAP">
            For the extra step, I wanted to figure out the 3 clashing words, "mr", "new", and "york".

            From looking up Ngram of the word "mr" from the total set(154 files), there were frequencies of 486. From looking up Ngram of the word "mr" from the collected files (44), there were frequencies of 179.

       <p class="TAP">
           From looking up Ngram with size 2 of the word "new york" from the total set (154) after interpreting both of the words "new" and "york" seems very familiar to me, there were frequencies of 193. Also in the collected files (44), there were 72 of the word "new york" mentioned. I’ve also looked up Ngram for individual words of each "new" and "york" for both total set and collected files, here is the result. There were 416 frequencies of the word "new" in the total set and 139 frequencies in the collected files. Also, there were 197 frequencies of the word "york" in the total set and 73 frequencies in the collected files. 
       </p>
        
       <p class="TAP">
           All together, those three words were considered "high frequency" or "keyword" from both categories of files because the word "mr" was used mostly to refer to the name of a male in the text, and "new york" was commonly mentioned in both text also because it was used when the text is discussing political content, they often mentioned "new york" as a state, the "New York Times" and/or "New York City"
       </p>
       
       <p class="TAP">
           To conclude this project, there was a stronger political connection in collected presidential election years text files, as there were specifically political-related vocabularies in the keywords map.
