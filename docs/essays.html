        <h2>Starter HTML instructions</h2>
       
        <p>Let's replace the old index.html in your GitHub repo with this new one as you're starting
            to learn HTML. The hardest part of this may be learning how to browse to find where you
            saved your files in your GitHub repo. You'll get used to this with practice and some
            organization.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In oXygen, go to File >> Save As, and <b>carefully browse</b> to find your GitHub
                repo and its <strong>docs/</strong> directory.</li>
            <li>Save this file inside your docs/ directory as <b>index.html</b>. You should save
                over any index.html you've already saved there to replace with this one. (Don't
                capitalize index.html, spelling counts and you need the .html part at the end.)</li>
            <li>Open your Bash shell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) at your GitHub repo.</li>
            <li>Use your git commands now. Check the <em>status</em> of your repo, <em>add</em> your
                files for staging, <em>commit</em> them with a message, and <em>push</em> them to
                the repo.</li>
            <li>Check your GitHub repo on the <q>code view</q> and the web view to see your
                updates.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For a more detailed view of HTML, look at <a href="index.html">the actual index.html on
                this introDH-Hub model website</a>. Feel free to work with that code as you're
            learning HTML.</p>
        <p>The easiest way we know to create a new page for your site is to save the current one
            you're working on with a new filename in the same directory. Open the new file so you
            can keep working. You'll need to create <a href="innerPage.html">a special kind of
                relative link to connect the pages</a>, like this.</p>
    </body>
