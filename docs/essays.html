            <p>Before I even decided to become a Digit student &#44; I talked to my professor&#46; 
                This is my third time challenging myself to learn coding after failing twice&#44; one from my high school and one from my previous college&#46; The most significant challenge to understand how everything just works 0 and 1 seems simple as it&#39;s just a two number but it was difficult to embrace it as it is&#46; As I was a little lost at the beginning of the class when we were setting up GitHub&#44; my uncertainty of the purpose of GitHub was the factor that slowed me down to truly explore all of the exciting HTML and CSS codes&#46; </p>
            
            
            <p>During the class&#44; I was introduced to two website development methods&#44; GitHub and PSU WordPress&#46; As I got introduced to GitHub&#44; now I can explain in my words that it&#39;s like a computing cloud system where authorized people can access your coding&#46; Through access&#44; your professor can edit and fix up any errors or mistakes from your codes and share them with classmates&#46; On the other hand&#44; PSU WordPress was something that I would consider a more simple way to start coding from basic by all of the templates that are 
                already made&#46; However&#44; I found it&#39;s not fully helpful to make self-progress and self-improvement by not allowing users to write up codes in lines&#46; As PSU WordPress doesn&#39;t have a cloud-kind of system where other people can have access to your codes of the sites&#44; it makes it difficult for learners to fix any error that they probably face a lot of times&#44; especially in the beginning&#46; </p>
            
            <p>During my journey to create my website &#34;Continuexperience&#34; I&#39;ve got stuck with image file format issues&#46; 
                Although there were no errors found in my coding&#44; a couple of the images that I put in for my index file were only showing up in my files, not on the GitHub site&#46; Later&#44; my professor and I found that it was a tiny matter of file format&#46; I&#39;ve used upper cases for some of the image files like JPG and PNG but some of them remain as lower cases&#46; Because I&#39;m using a Mac which is not GitHub&#44; 
                it is fully cooperative and there were some delivery issues from my image file to GitHub&#46;</p>
            
            <p>Both of the formats require you to interpret the HTML codings and RGBA colour to make it fancy&#46; 
                While using GitHub&#44; using Git Bash to do all the commands like pull and push to make sure GitHub codes for your site is up to date was an extra part that was required&#46; </p>
            
            <p>In the future&#44; I&#39;m looking forward to learning about Python Programming as I wish to handle some big data&#46; 
                I&#39;ve already looking up project materials from websites called Kaggle&#44; however&#44; 
                I haven&#39;t learned any Python programming yet so there&#39;s not much I can do for now&#46; I believe one day I will learn Python programming and some other data related programming languages to bring a useful and relevant result from a project that can contribute to our society&#46;</p>
