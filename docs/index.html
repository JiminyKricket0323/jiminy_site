                    <div class="AbtMe">
                        <p>At 23 years old, a unique blend of cultural experiences defines this individual, originating from the vibrant landscapes of South Korea. Formative years unfolded against the picturesque backdrop of New Zealand, navigating the challenges and triumphs of middle and high school. Currently on the verge of completing a bachelor's degree in the serene environs of Pennsylvania, United States, academia represents the latest chapter in this international journey.</p>
                        <p>Outside of classes, you'll find me getting peace and thrills in wide-open fields, especially when I'm on a horse. This horseback adventure isn't just a hobby-it's a deep journey that gives me a feeling of freedom, achievement, and conquering personal fears. Besides riding, my heart beats fast for sports, and golf is a big part of my life. On the golf course, it's like entering a strategic zone where I carefully plan and pull off moves, seeing connections between the game and life itself. As I cruise through the fairways, surrounded by nature's calm, I feel a strong connection with the world-an easygoing bond that turns the game into more than just a physical experience.
